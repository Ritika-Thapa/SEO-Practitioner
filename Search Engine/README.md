## Search Engine

**_Search Engine_**, is a web-based software application that enables users to retrieve information from the vast and interconnected world of the internet.
Users input specific keywords or phrases, and the _search engine_ uses complex algorithms to scan, index, and rank web pages and content, presenting a list of relevant results.

Google uses a program called a **Crawler** or **Spider** to index web content and make it searchable on its _search engine_. 
+ The _Google Crawler (Googlebot)_ is primarily used to index and make web content searchable for users who are searching for something using keywords on the Google search engine.
+ The Google crawler (Googlebot) makes web content that would otherwise be invisible to others, or "hidden" on the internet, visible to people who use Google to search for information. 
+ By crawling and indexing websites, Googlebot allows web pages to appear in Google's search results, making them accessible to users searching for specific topics, keywords, or information.
